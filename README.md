### 🛡️ Safety & Automation (2.1.0)

- 🗓️ **Scheduling & Auto-Restore**: Apply changes at a future date/time and automatically put the original prices back later (runs through WooCommerce's bundled Action Scheduler)
- 🔢 **Price Rounding**: Round to the nearest / up / down to a multiple (e.g. 1000) or use charm endings (`.99`, `99`, `900`)
- ⛔ **Price Limits**: Never lower a price below, or raise it above, a value you choose
- 📊 **Whole-catalog Summary**: Products that will change, increases vs. decreases and the net price impact — recalculated live as you remove rows
- ⬇️ **CSV Export**: Download the complete preview (not just the visible page)

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

#### 1. Choose Your Operation
Select from four powerful operation types:
- **⬆️ Increase Regular Price**: Add to existing prices
- **⬇️ Decrease Regular Price**: Reduce existing prices
- **🏷️ Apply/Update Sale Price**: Set discount prices
- **❌ Remove All Discounts**: Clear all sale prices

#### 2. Set Change Amount
Choose **ONE** of these methods:
- **📊 Percentage (%)**: Change prices by a percentage (e.g., 10% increase)
- **💰 Fixed Amount**: Change prices by a fixed value (e.g., 5000 Rial)

> ⚠️ **Important**: Only fill ONE field. If both are filled, no changes will be applied.

#### 3. Configure Advanced Options

- ✅ Enable to process only products currently on sale
- ⬜ Disable to process all products (default)

- **Sync OFF**: Sale price stays the same (discount % changes)

#### 4. Apply Filters (Optional)
- **🗂️ Category**: Select a specific category or "All Categories"
- **📅 Sale Start Date**: Set when the sale should begin (for sale price operations)

### Design Patterns

#### MVC Architecture
- **Models**: Business logic and data manipulation
- **Views**: Template files for UI rendering
- **Controllers**: Request handling and orchestration

#### Single Responsibility Principle
Each class has one clear purpose:
- `Bulk_Pricer_Price_Calculator`: Mathematical price calculations
- `Bulk_Pricer_Product_Data_Formatter`: Data formatting and presentation
- `Bulk_Pricer_Date_Handler`: Date operations and formatting
- `Bulk_Pricer_Formatter`: General formatting utilities

#### Dependency Injection
Clean, testable code with explicit dependencies:
```php
public function __construct() {
    $this->price_calc = new Bulk_Pricer_Price_Calculator();
    $this->date_handler = new Bulk_Pricer_Date_Handler();
    $this->formatter = new Bulk_Pricer_Product_Data_Formatter();
}
```

### Key Technical Features

#### Precision Handling
Eliminates floating-point errors common with large numbers:
```php
// Before: 21,676,000 - 1,000,000 = 20,676,001 ❌
// After: Perfect calculation = 20,676,000 ✅
$new_price = (int) round($price, 0, PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN);
```

#### Batch Processing
Handles unlimited products without PHP timeout:
- Processes 20 products per batch
- AJAX-based pagination
- Progress tracking with visual feedback

#### Security
- Nonce verification on all AJAX requests
- Capability checks (`manage_options`)
- Input sanitization and validation
- Prevents direct file access

#### Translation System
WordPress-native i18n implementation:
```php
// PHP templates
echo esc_html__('Product Name', 'bulk-price-discount-editor-for-woocommerce');

// JavaScript localization
wp_localize_script('bulk-pricer-admin-js', 'sbp_vars', array(
    'i18n' => array(
        'loading_preview' => __('Loading preview page', 'bulk-price-discount-editor-for-woocommerce')
    )
));
```

### Advanced Configuration
For developers, you can hook into plugin operations:

```php
// Before price changes are applied
add_action('sbp_before_price_update', function($product_id, $old_price, $new_price) {
    // Your custom logic
}, 10, 3);

// After price changes are applied
add_action('sbp_after_price_update', function($product_id, $new_price) {
    // Your custom logic
}, 10, 2);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "WooCommerce is Required" Notice
**Solution**: Install and activate WooCommerce before activating this plugin.

#### Translations Not Working
**Solution**:
1. Go to `Settings > General`
2. Set correct language (e.g., فارسی for Persian)
3. Deactivate and reactivate the plugin
4. Clear browser cache

#### Price Changes Not Applying
**Checks**:
- Only ONE of "Percentage" or "Fixed Amount" should be filled
- Value must be greater than 0
- Products must exist in selected category/filters

#### Timeout Errors
**Solution**: The plugin uses batch processing to prevent timeouts. If you still experience issues:
- Increase PHP `max_execution_time` in php.ini
- Contact your hosting provider

## 📊 Performance

### Benchmarks
- **Small Store** (100-500 products): < 2 seconds
- **Medium Store** (500-2,000 products): 5-15 seconds
- **Large Store** (2,000-10,000 products): 20-60 seconds
- **Enterprise** (10,000+ products): Scales linearly with batch processing

### Optimization Tips
- Use category filters to target specific products
- Process during off-peak hours for large operations
- Enable object caching (Redis/Memcached) for better performance

## 📜 Changelog

### Version 2.1.0
#### ✨ New
- Undo & change history (per-product old/new prices, resume interrupted runs, CSV download of a run)
- Scheduled apply and auto-restore via Action Scheduler
- Price rounding (nearest/up/down multiples, charm endings), price floor/ceiling
- New operations: exact regular/sale price, increase/decrease sale price only, make sale permanent, round prices only

- "Only on sale" now edits only the variations that are on sale (previously every variation of a variable product with any variation on sale)
- Sale dates from the form were applied to *every* operation (e.g. overwriting schedules on "Increase regular price"); they now only apply to operations that create a sale

- Sale sync now also covers sales scheduled for the future
- Preview pages hold exactly 20 rows and the total counts variations (previously a page could hold hundreds of rows)
